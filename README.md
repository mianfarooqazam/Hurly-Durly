"# Hurlydurly" 
This is a simple to-do app built with react-native. For routing react-navigation is used. React native elements and nativebase.io is used for UI. This app let users add, edit and delete their todo's once completed. Both user authentication and user authorization is taken into account. Back4app (BaaS) is used for backend of this app.
Application splash screen animation has been downloaded from https://lottiefiles.com/. Thanks to {Jean Massad} for that.

Just add lottie-react-native to your package.json file and you are good to go.
Any kind of changes would be highly appreciated.
